Targeted Memory Reactivation During Sleep

Who wouldn't love acing a geography exam and remembering the locations of all the countries on the map? Or, avoiding the embarrassment of suddenly forgetting the name of the person standing right in front of you? Memory, like any other muscle in our body or a language we know how to speak, can be strengthened and enhanced. How? By simply using two ingredients: sleep and sound. It has been recently shown that playing distinctive sounds when people are learning a task and then replaying those same sounds when people are asleep, leads to improvement in recall of such cued vs. uncued memories.  This targeted memory reactivation (TMR) is said to be most effective during Slow Wave Sleep (SWS) or stage 3 of our sleep cycle. Exploring this incredible relationship, and understanding the selectivity of memory consolidation can cause a paradigm shift in the way we learn and teach. For that, we are aiming to produce a complete experiment were people can download an application along with our EEG headband and be able to detect SWS sleep, perform memory tasks, and cue sounds during sleep. This will yet to be another potential way Backyard Brains is paving the way for a more inclusive and accessible citizen science, where having a mini sleep lab in the comfort of our own homes is possible!
